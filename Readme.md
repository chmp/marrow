# `marrow` - minimalist Arrow interop

[Crate info](https://crates.io/crates/marrow)
| [API docs](https://docs.rs/marrow/)

`marrow` allows building and viewing arrow arrays of different implementations using a unified
interface. The motivation behind `marrow` is to allow libraries to target multiple different arrow
versions simultaneously.

## Development

All important development tasks are packaged in the `x.py` script. It does not require any external
dependencies and can be executed with any recent Python version.

- `python x.py precommit`: wrapper around `format`, `check`, `test`
- `python x.py test`: execute the tests
- `python x.py check`: run linters
- `python x.py format`: format the source code
- `cargo test --all-features` execute the tests without the `x.py` script
